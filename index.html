      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p>I am a beginner programmer, I know a bit about computers, and I like to repair stuff. My professional career
      is sort of laid out in my resume but for the sake of one page I didn't provide my entire working history (Customer service work).
      I am trying to gain momentum in my professional development career and just working with tech in a professional setting. I have
      a lot to do and I want to explore a lot with this specific website. Whether it's UI or interactive content, I am going to attempt
      it all.. over time. My first step is getting the content and interaction I want from the site. This for me starts with a blog like
      form, for me and users. </p>
