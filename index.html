        <h2>Hello! Welcome.. Website Design is a struggle if you couldn't tell.</h2>
        <p id = "pSimpleWelcome">Thank you for visiting.. I would like this page to showcase
           basic web development capabilities. I will forever be improving the look and feel of the site
           as it doesn't look great or feel like anything is here. Not very interactive but it will be a
           better place holder than what I had on here previously. I plan to mess around with the sizes and
           layout. I think my main focus will be improving the look of the site. Also there's a prototype page
           where I will prolly mess around with certain things so you can check progress that I make there..
           <br>A side note, Github seems to have a problem with me uploading these files how I am, that aren't
           being updated as soon as I merge to the master.. Just a note
          <br>
          Feel free to contact me, even if you only want to chat.</p>
        <h2>Some interests:</h2>
        <p id = "pSomeInterests"><b>Firstly</b> I have an interest in design.. Whether it's code, UI, or a product,
           it's something that is on the forefront of my mind. Branding is important so I haven't done the greatest
           job with this site but it will improve.
           <br>I like technology, gadgets, phones, computers.. Things that
           improve our standard of living and connect us as a civilization. The connection and innvoatoin drive my interest
           to mess around with these constantly changing enviroments..
           <br>
           <b>Something</b> I would like to improve on is my soldering skills, my coding as an endeavor, and workout more as it will
           keep me healthier, I eat a lot of pizza..
           <br>Playing video games is another past time that I enjoy, from
           text based MUDS to First Person Shooters like Team Fortress Two. I like to play games and will make one. </p>
