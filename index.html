        <h2>Hello! Welcome.. Website Design is a struggle if you couldn't tell. </h2>
        <p id = "pSimpleWelcome">Thank you for visiting.. I would like this page to showcase
           basic understanding of my web development capabilities. I will forever be improving the look of this site as it doesn't look great. Not very interactive but it
            will be a better place holder than what I had on here previously. I plan to mess around with the sizes and layout of the general page. I think my main focus will
            be improving the look of the site.
          <br>
          Feel free to contact me, even if you only want to chat.</p>
        <h2>Some interests:</h2>
        <p id = "pSomeInterests"><b>Firstly</b> I have an interest in design.. Whether it's code, UI, or a product,
           it's something that is on the forefront of my mind. Branding is important so I haven't done the greatest job with this site but it will improve. <br>
           I like technology, gadgets, phones, computers.. Things that improve our standard of living, interest me and drive me to mess around with it..<br>
           <b>Something</b> I would like to improve on is my soldering skills, my coding as an endeavor, and workout more as it will keep me healthier, I eat a lot of pizza..<br>
           Playing video games is another past time that I enjoy, from text based MUDS to First Person Shooters like Team Fortress Two. I like to play games and will make one. </p>
